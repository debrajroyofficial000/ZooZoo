# ZooZoo - Memory Booster Game

Welcome to ZooZoo, a memory booster game built with React JS and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Overview

ZooZoo is a fun and interactive game designed to improve your memory skills. The game presents players with various levels of difficulty - easy, medium, and hard. Upon selecting a level, players are presented with a grid of cards, each containing a unique image.

## How to Play

1. **Choose a Level**: Select one of the three levels - easy, medium, or hard.
2. **Memory Challenge**: Once a level is chosen, a grid of cards will appear. Memorize the position of the cards as they will shuffle once you click on one.
3. **Click a Card**: Click on any card to reveal its hidden image.
4. **Remember & Match**: Remember the position of the revealed card. Your objective is to find its matching pair.
5. **Match Pairs**: Click on another card to find its matching pair. If the cards match, they will disappear from the grid. If they don't match, the cards will be shuffled, and you can try again.
6. **Complete the Level**: Continue matching pairs until all cards have been removed from the grid. You will then advance to the next level.
7. **Scoreboard**: Keep track of your score on the small scoreboard.

## Game Rules

- If you match all pairs, you advance to the next level.
- If you fail to match a pair, the game resets, and you must start from level 1.
- Each level increases in difficulty with more cards to match.
