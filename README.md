# ZooZoo - Memory Booster Game

Welcome to ZooZoo, a memory booster game built with React JS and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Overview

ZooZoo is a fun and interactive game designed to improve your memory skills. The game presents players with various levels of difficulty - easy, medium, and hard. Upon selecting a level, players are presented with a grid of cards, each containing a unique image.

### How to Play

1. **Select Your Preferred Difficulty Level**: Choose between easy, medium, or hard.
2. **Click Any Card**: Click on any card, image attached to it.
3. **Memorize and Match**: Try to memorize the card's image and avoid clicking the same card again.
4. **Shuffle Cards**: After each click, all the cards will shuffle, keeping you on your toes!
5. **Continue Matching**: Keep clicking and matching pairs until you've uncovered all the cards.
6. **Complete Level**: If you manage to click on each card only once, a pop-up will appear, allowing you to either replay the game or advance to the next level.
7. **Final Level Finish**: Upon completing the final level, you can restart the game to challenge yourself again.

## Game Rules

- If you match all pairs, you advance to the next level.
